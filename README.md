# Devfolio

Devfolio is a web app that allows developers to build there own portfolio and share it with the world. Without putting extra effort of designing and building a portfolio from scratch. I got the idea from my own experience of building my portfolio and realizing how time consuming it is and after getting the same feedback from most of my friends who are applying for internships, I wanted to build a portfolio generator that is easy to use and looks good. So I decided to build Devfolio & I am still working on making it more easy to use and adding more features.
